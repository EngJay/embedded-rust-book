# The Embedded Rust Book Work-Through

*My work-through of
[The Embedded Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/embedded-book/).*

I'm come up with the term "work-through" for instances of my practice of working
through examples, books, and tutorials to keep up with the software industry and
continuosly improve my skills and knowledge.
