# Work-Through: The Embedded Rust Book

*My work-through[^1] of
[The Embedded Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/embedded-book/).*

[^1]: The term "work-through" is what I've come up with for instances of my
  practice of working through examples, books, tutorials, etc., to keep up with the
  software industry and continuously improve my skills and knowledge.

The key difference between what I've done in this repo and what is described in
the The Embedded Rust Book is I've used my own framework for containerizing
build environments to keep everything decoupled from my workstation machine and
easily reproducible.

## Dependencies

This repo depends on the
[build-systems](https://github.com/EngJay/build-systems)
repo to provide its build environment. It is included as a submodule in the
root of the repo. Clone this repo with submodules included recursively to pull
in everything needed to build in a Docker container.

## Building

TODO

To open a shell in a build environment container, run from the root of the repo.

```bash
> ./build-systems/scripts/shell.sh ORG_NAME:IMAGE_NAME:VERSION
```

You should get a similar response to this confirming the input.

```bash
Open Shell in Docker Image
============================================================

Org: ORG_NAME
Image: IMAGE_NAME
Version: VERSION

root@ca5eda15a2f0:/#
```

## Notes

Notes, tips, and tricks.

### QEMU Warning "Timer with period zero, disabling"

An odd warning is generated by QEMU when running the `hello.rs` example but it
doesn't seem to interfere with the simulation.

```bash
root@ca5eda15a2f0:/repo/qemu-example# cargo run --example hello --release
   Compiling typenum v1.17.0
   Compiling generic-array v0.14.7

```

### Debugging in QEMU in a Docker Container

To debug the applications in QEMU running in a Docker container:

1. Run QEMU in a container to wait for a connection from `gdb`.
2. Open a second terminal window, then open a second shell in the running
  container.
3. Connect to the running instance of QEMU using `gdb`.
