# The Embedded Rust Book Work-Through

*My work-through[^1] of
[The Embedded Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/embedded-book/).*

[^1]: The term "work-through" is what I've come up with for instances of my
  practice of working through examples, books, and tutorials to keep up with the
  software industry andcontinuosly improve my skills and knowledge.
